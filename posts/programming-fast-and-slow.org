Move /fast/. Do. Feed. Back. Do. More.

Interact. Let the flow guide you. Be present. Change things. Se how it works.
See what you like. Try something completely different. Follow your train of
thought all the way. Change /everything/ -- leave no stone unturned.

Slow /down/. Be the rock.

Let the storm blow; rage; scream; its turbulence does not phase you. Your
infinite presence is there; unwaving; stationary
