Approaching theory from a dogma is fundamentally different from approaching it
as a non-total tool of potential value.

Theory-as-dogma restrains conception to what may be expressed within the system
around the theory. Theory-as-tool does not claim to be total, and keeps a proper
relationship to the transcendent.

# Sidenote: Read up on doctrine/dogma/disipline as used in military
# organizations? What is written about this? Anything I can make use of?
