Sharing knowledge is essential. I'm starting here. Why? For others and for me.
I may write something that others find useful. A piece of notes that can grow
into actual knowledge. At the same time, I tend to start things and loose
interest when I feel that I've cracked the nut. Actually pushing something to
completion is a valuable experience. 

The system for sharing knowledge should remove barriers from the flow of
information. Writing in the system should be comfortable and flexible: It should
not distract from writing, and should not limit what can be communicated. The
reader should be able to find the content and understand it. This is what I try
to accomplish.
