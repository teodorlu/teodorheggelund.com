The intersection is interesting.

Peterson utters that to speak truth is to be powerful. Surgebinders in
Sanderson's tales have to speak the ideals before progressing.

Taleb speaks of risk taking and skin in the game as a foundational virtue.
Carrying a load as heavy as one can manage is considered by Peterson to be the
only worthwhile quest there is.

- /Truth/ is considered powerful by all.
- /Individual responsibility/ is considered the essence of virtue or progress.
