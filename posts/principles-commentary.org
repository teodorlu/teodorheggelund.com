I am thoroughly impressed with Ray Dalio's [[https://www.principles.com][/Principles/]]. /Principles/ is a
description of a philosophy of life founded on principles. Dalio searches
actively in his own experience, out of which he attempts to produce principles
for how to act.

A central theme in the book is the process surrounding the principles:

- How does one make decisions based on principles?
- How to change a principle that produces bad results?
- How can one develop new principles?

I believe his approach can be useful for people with a principled mindset --
including me. This text is my attempt at making the principles my own. How to
these principles apply to me? How do I judge them? Do I have specific examples
or experiences, that can help ground the principles and give them context?

The principles are formulated in three levels. Level one principles are broad
and general, and may contain level two and level three principles, which are
more specific. This text retains the hierarchical structure of the principles,
with my commentary.
