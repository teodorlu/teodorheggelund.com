title: Fix your E-mail chaos with immutability and inversion of control

*State: DRAFTED OUTLINE*

Principles:

1. One E-mail address per service. If they sell your E-mail, you know who to
   distrust, and you can create a specific rule to disallow their E-mail.
2. Keep an internal mapping between "immutable" accounts and priority.

Together, these two allow you to cleanly separate what E-mail you get from
accounts, and what E-mail you get from other people.

Requirements:

- You must have your own domain.
- Your E-mail provider must have a flexible rule system. I use Fastmail, which
  works great for me.

So, what are nice mechanisms for this?

- One general catch-all Other folder.
- One E-mail just for humans.
- You're able to provide categorization. I differentiate between general
  accounts (services+SERVICENAME@mydomain.com), shopping
  (shopping+SERVICENAME@mydomain.com) and tickets and booking
  (booking+SERVICENAME@teodorheggelund.com).
- I generally exclude everything but mail from people from my Inbox.
- When I've read and acted on the E-mail in my inbox, I archive it.
- E-mail from services usually stays in its category for retrieval, if needed.
